## Project info

**URL**: https://NODO AI Vaults.dev/projects/5f9801db-6e7c-4942-b99e-6af02d9f3c32

## Showcase Build

All on-chain logic stubbed for offline demos; UI flow is 1-to-1 with production. The showcase build provides a fully self-contained experience with:

- Connect Wallet flow with multiple wallet options
- Initial balance of 100,000 USDC and 100,000 NDLP
- Full deposit/withdraw/claim flows with realistic delays
- 24-hour withdrawal cooldown with countdown timer
- Persistent state using localStorage

To run the showcase:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm run dev
```

### Linting

Run the linter after installing dependencies to check code quality:

```sh
npm run lint
```

The showcase build blocks all external network requests for security while providing an authentic user experience identical to the production app.
